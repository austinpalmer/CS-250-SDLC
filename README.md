# CS-250-SDLC

This is the Sprint Retrospective for the SNHU Travel project.

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You can interpret user needs by gathering stories and epics from users. By interviewing these indvidiuals, we gain
insight to what a user's workflow looks like and what they need or want out of an application. Once you get the stories, 
you can break them down into basic needs which will guide programmers to understand what needs to be done.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I approach developing programs by first understanding the purpose of the application and how to go about creating an 
object-oriented program. I hope to incorporate Scrum or Extreme Programming in my future work as it not only builds
communication with your development team but it generates creativity within the team which only improves the potential 
quality of the product.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member means being honest, respectful, and supportive with your team members. This creates an
atmosphere that embraces creativity and opens conversation which increases the efficiency of your team and the
quality of the application being developed.
